# js-roadmap

I learn JS here
My training based on <a href="https://learn.javascript.ru/">the JS Book</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbk2qRZtWSzCIN38JC_NdhW5">the freecodes playlist</a>.

The base concepts are in "script" folder. There is no html, only js code.

You can open each script in window by url or can run this by Node.js with command 'node scriptName.js'.
